Powered by Sovryn, Origins is an exciting way for new projects to kickstart their community and receive funding. Origins provides the tools for startups to show individuality yet still have access to an entire community in the areas where support is needed most.

Origins is a decentralized launchpad. Origins serves as a decentralized community funding launchpad for early stage crypto projects/protocols to increase outreach, raise investment, build a devoted community, and access Origins’ platform benefits.

The Origins platform is entirely decentralized. Origins also has a native utility token called the OG token. This token has numerous use cases, such as participating in governance and selecting or denying proposals.
